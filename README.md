# Todo-API
I made this API using InMemory database then can't need use SQL.

First step: you'll need dotnet core 5 sdk installed;

Second Step: to run you need to give the command "dotnet watch run";

Third Step: Enjoy;

You can test the API using Rest Client extension in your visual studio code. Open todo.http file and send requests.
